Each subdirectory contains a portion of the design:

- `KiCad` contains the design files for the Cody Computer's electronics.
- `OpenSCAD` contains the design files for the Cody Computer's printable parts.
- `STL` contains the generated STL files suitable for slicing and printing.
- `Spin` contains the Propeller `.spin` files for the Propeller's firmware.
- `Tass` contains the `64tass` assembly files for Cody BASIC and demo programs.
- `CodyBASIC` contains some sample Cody BASIC programs used for demo purposes.
 
All design files and sources are released under the GPL version 3. The
Cody Computer Book included with the sources is not but may be freely
distributed. 

Note that the book is still in draft form and updates will be made to
the repository in the future.
